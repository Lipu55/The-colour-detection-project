Color Recognition Project: Advancing Computer Vision for Accurate Color Detection
# The main objective of the Color Detection Project is to develop a computer vision system capable of accurately identifying and recognizing colors in images or video frames. The goal is to create a robust system that can detect and classify various colors present in the input, enabling applications such as color-based object tracking, image analysis, and automation.
